# bachelor_thesis
A repository for code used for a bachelor thesis, which is available at: https://dspace.vsb.cz/handle/10084/147319

To correctly run this code, install Processing (available from https://processing.org/download), paste the code into the IDE and click run. To retrieve exported images, press Ctrl+K, which opens up the project's folder. By default, new projects will be created at C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp on Windows unless resaved first.

As of 20 April 2022, the Processing IDE does not yet correctly export Java applets, so for the time being, this is the only reliable method of providing access to my code.
